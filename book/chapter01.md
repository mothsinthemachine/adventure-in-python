## Taming the Python

No doubt you've heard of the language of Python: Beginner friendly, easy to learn, hard to master. Claims regarding this language are not unfounded--since its inception by Guido van Rossum in the late '80s, it has undergone three transformations: its first release in 1991 (Python 1), its second release in 2000 (Python 2), and it's third and current release in 2008 (Python 3). With over three decades of improvements and revisions, it has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

But you have no time for a history lesson! You are ready to get started!

### Installing Python

First, you need to acquire Python on your machine of choice. Regardless of what machine you choose, Python is well-known and compatible with many kinds of devices. Hopefully, it remains that way for years to come, no matter what operating systems we adjust to!

1. A good starting point would be to download the files for Python. You can find the download package for your operating system (OS) of choice [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Download the latest release for the time being.
2. Find the downloaded package file and click to extract its contents. You might need a file manager to help you with this.
